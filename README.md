# wyrm 🐉

Repeatable tmux session layouts from a TOML config — nested split trees,
lifecycle hooks, one static binary.

Drop a `.wyrm.toml` in your project, run `wyrm`, and get the same windows,
panes, and running commands every time.

```toml
[session]
root = "."

[[windows]]
name = "code"

  [[windows.splits]]
  command = "nvim"

  [[windows.splits]]
  type = "h"          # split horizontally: new pane on the right
  size = 30           # it gets 30% of the width
  command = "npm run dev"
```

## Why another one?

| | Language | Config | Runtime deps | Layouts as split *trees* | Lifecycle hooks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tmuxinator | Ruby | YAML | Ruby | — | ✓ |
| tmuxp | Python | YAML/JSON | Python | — | ✓ |
| smug | Go | YAML | none | — | ✓ |
| **wyrm** | Go | **TOML** | none | **✓** | ✓ |

- **TOML, not YAML** — comment-friendly, no indentation traps.
- **Splits are a tree** — nest splits inside splits with explicit percentage
  sizes, instead of picking from preset layouts.
- **Pane-ID targeting** — layouts come out the same regardless of your
  `base-index` / `pane-base-index` settings.
- **One static binary** — Go stdlib plus a TOML parser, nothing at runtime
  but tmux itself.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/jskoll/wyrm@latest
```

Or build from a clone: `make install` (uses `go install` with a stamped version).

## Usage

```sh
wyrm                       # use .wyrm.toml (or legacy .tmuxconfig) in the cwd
wyrm -config path/to/file  # explicit config
wyrm -kill                 # destroy the session (runs on_project_exit first)
wyrm -version
```

Creating a session **replaces** any existing session with the same name, then
attaches — or switches your current client if you're already inside tmux.

## Config reference

### `[session]`

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | basename of `root` | tmux session name |
| `root` | string | `.` | Working directory for every window; `$VAR` is expanded |
| `on_project_start` | string | — | Shell command run (via `bash -c`, in `root`) before the session is created |
| `on_project_exit` | string | — | Shell command run before `wyrm -kill` destroys the session |
| `startup_window` | string | first window | Window (name or index) to focus after creation |
| `startup_pane` | int | — | Pane to focus within `startup_window` (uses your `pane-base-index`) |

At least one of `name` / `root` is required.

### `[[windows]]`

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | — | Window name |
| `pre_window` | string | — | Command typed into **every pane** before its own command (e.g. `nvm use 18`) |
| `splits` | list | — | Split tree (below) — the recommended layout format |
| `panes` | list | — | Legacy flat pane list (below); ignored when `splits` is set |
| `layout` | string | `tiled` | tmux layout applied after legacy `panes` (`even-horizontal`, `main-vertical`, ...) |

### `[[windows.splits]]` — the split tree

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | — | `h`/`horizontal` or `v`/`vertical`. **Omit** to target the pane created by the previous entry (or the window's first pane) without splitting |
| `size` | int | tmux default | Percentage of space given to the new pane (1–99) |
| `command` | string | — | Typed into the pane; entries starting with `#` are comments and skipped |
| `children` | list | — | Nested splits, applied inside this entry's pane |

How the tree is walked: each entry with a `type` splits the pane of the
previous entry at the same level (the window's initial pane for the first
entry). `children` do the same, starting from their parent's pane.

```toml
[[windows]]
name = "dev"

  [[windows.splits]]
  command = "nvim"            # window's first pane

  [[windows.splits]]
  type = "h"                  # split it: new right-hand pane, 30%
  size = 30
  command = "npm run dev"

    [[windows.splits.children]]
    type = "v"                # split the right-hand pane: bottom half
    size = 50
    command = "npm test -- --watch"
```

### `[[windows.panes]]` — legacy flat list

```toml
[[windows]]
name = "tests"
layout = "even-horizontal"

[[windows.panes]]
command = "npm test -- --watch"

[[windows.panes]]
command = "# scratch"          # comment: pane is created, nothing runs
```

Panes split alternately h/v, then `layout` (default `tiled`) evens them out.

More in [`examples/`](examples/): minimal, Node.js, PHP/Symfony, Python,
nested splits.

## Security

A wyrm config **executes shell commands by design** — hooks run via
`bash -c`, and pane commands are typed into your shell. Treat config files
with the same trust as a `Makefile` or `.envrc`: don't run one you haven't
read.

## Development

```sh
make build       # build ./wyrm
make test        # unit + integration (integration needs tmux; isolated socket)
make test-unit   # -short: unit tests only
make lint        # golangci-lint + gofmt
```
