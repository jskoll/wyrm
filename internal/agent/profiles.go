// ProfilesFrom builds the detector's profiles from the user's settings, and
// reports what is wrong with them rather than quietly falling back — a
// mistyped busy_pattern that silently disabled the markers looks exactly like
// an agent that never waits for you.
//
// Layering: an explicit [[tui.agent.profiles]] list replaces the built-in
// profile outright, because a user who has described their own agents has said
// what wyrm should look for, and folding the shipped Claude patterns back in
// would let one agent's chrome decide another's state. A bare `commands` list
// instead widens the built-in profile, which is what someone running Claude
// Code under a wrapper name wants.
//
// This lives here, rather than next to either caller, because there are three
// of them — the TUI's marker scan, `wyrm status`, and `wyrm doctor` — and two
// had already grown their own copy of it. Importing internal/config from this
// package is safe and deliberate: the dependency the AgentProfile comment
// guards against is the other direction, config depending on the detector.
