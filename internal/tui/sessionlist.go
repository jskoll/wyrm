// This file describes what the Sessions panel lists.
//
// By default it lists what tmux is running, and that is the whole answer. With
// "all" toggled on ("a") it also lists every discoverable project that is
// *not* running, so "reach the session I already have" and "start the one I
// don't" are one list instead of two panels — which is the only way `wyrm
// pick`, whose compact form has no Projects panel, can start anything at all.
//
// The two kinds of row are one type rather than two lists because every
// consumer — the cursor, the filter, the renderer, the mouse hit test — indexes
// rows positionally and must not care which kind it landed on.

// sessionEntry is one row of the Sessions panel.
type sessionEntry struct {
	// Name is what the row is filtered and rendered by: the tmux session name
	// for a running row, the session name the config would produce for a
	// stopped one.
	Name string

	// Session is the live tmux session. Only meaningful when Running — a
	// stopped row has no session ID, which is precisely why every
	// session-targeting action guards on currentSession's ok.
	Session sessions.Session
	Running bool

	// Project is the config this row can be started from, and HasProject
	// whether there is one. A stopped row always has one (nothing else could
	// have put it in the list); a running row has one only when a discovered
	// project shares its name, which is what lets a session started outside
	// wyrm still appear here with nothing to start.

	HasProject bool

// sessionEntries builds the panel's rows: the running sessions in tmux's own
// most-recently-active order, then — with allSessions on — the discovered
// projects that aren't among them, in discovery order.
//
// Stopped rows come last rather than being interleaved by name: the running
// ones are the ones with live state behind them (windows, panes, agent
// markers), and sorting a stopped row between them would move the row a user
// was about to press Enter on every time a session's activity changed.
