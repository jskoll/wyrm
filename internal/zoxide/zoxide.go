// Package zoxide integrates with the optional zoxide binary for
// frecency-based directory discovery: jumping to a directory you've cd'd
// into often, whether or not it has a wyrm config of its own.
//
// This is wyrm's only dependency on a binary other than tmux, which is
// worth being deliberate about: every function here assumes the caller has
// already checked Available, and the feature that uses this package
// (internal/tui's Projects panel) is opt-in via settings and silently
// absent otherwise — never a hard requirement, never on by default just
// because zoxide happens to be installed.
