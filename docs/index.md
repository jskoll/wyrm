# wyrm

Repeatable tmux session layouts from a TOML config — nested split trees,
lifecycle hooks, one static binary.

Drop a `.wyrm.toml` in your project, run `wyrm`, and get the same windows,
panes, and running commands every time.

```toml
[session]
root = "."

[[windows]]
name = "code"

  [[windows.splits]]
  command = "nvim"

  [[windows.splits]]
  type = "h"          # split horizontally: new pane on the right
  size = 30           # it gets 30% of the width
  command = "npm run dev"
```

## Why another one?

| | Language | Config | Runtime deps | Layouts as split *trees* | Lifecycle hooks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tmuxinator | Ruby | YAML | Ruby | — | ✓ |
| tmuxp | Python | YAML/JSON | Python | — | ✓ |
| smug | Go | YAML | none | — | ✓ |
| **wyrm** | Go | **TOML** | none | **✓** | ✓ |

- **TOML, not YAML** — comment-friendly, no indentation traps.
- **Splits are a tree** — nest splits inside splits with explicit percentage
  sizes, instead of picking from preset layouts.
- **Pane-ID targeting** — layouts come out the same regardless of your
  `base-index` / `pane-base-index` settings.
- **One static binary** — Go stdlib plus a TOML parser, nothing at runtime
  but tmux itself.

## Install

```sh
brew install jskoll/tap/wyrm
```

Or via Go:

```sh
go install github.com/jskoll/wyrm@latest
```

Or build from a clone: `make install` (uses `go install` with a stamped version).

## Usage

```sh
wyrm                       # use .wyrm.toml (or legacy .tmuxconfig) in the cwd
wyrm -config path/to/file  # explicit config
wyrm -kill                 # destroy the session (runs on_project_exit first)
wyrm -version
```

If neither `.wyrm.toml` nor `.tmuxconfig` is found, wyrm falls back to a
built-in default: a single unnamed window rooted at the current directory.

If a session with the same name is already running, wyrm **reattaches** to
it instead of rebuilding it. Otherwise it builds the session fresh, then
attaches.

Run from inside an existing tmux client, wyrm switches the client to the
session instead of nesting one tmux inside another.

See the [configuration reference](configuration.md) for the full `.wyrm.toml`
format, or the [examples](examples.md) for ready-to-use configs.
