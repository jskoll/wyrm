# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Extracted from [dragon-cli](https://github.com/jskoll/dragon-cli) as a
  standalone project named **wyrm** (history preserved).
- `.wyrm.toml` as the default config name; the original `.tmuxconfig` still
  works as a fallback.
- `-version` flag.
- Config validation with helpful errors (unknown split types, out-of-range
  sizes).
- Unit test suite (mocked tmux runner) and integration tests against a real
  tmux server on an isolated socket.
- CI (GitHub Actions, macOS + Linux), golangci-lint, goreleaser config.

### Changed
- Panes are targeted by tmux pane ID (`%N`) instead of index, so layouts no
  longer depend on the user's `base-index` / `pane-base-index` settings.
- `pre_window` runs in every pane before its command (as documented), not
  just the first.
- Split-tree semantics defined precisely: each entry splits the pane of the
  previous entry at its level; children work within their parent's pane.
- Structural failures exit with an error; per-pane failures warn and
  continue (now a stated contract).

### Removed
- Arbitrary `time.Sleep` synchronization (tmux commands are synchronous).
- Config-path allowlist validation — configs execute commands by design, so
  restricting their location added friction without security (see README).

### Fixed
- `wyrm -kill` no longer runs `on_project_exit` when the session isn't
  running.
